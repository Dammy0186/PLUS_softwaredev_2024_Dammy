One quotation you like: As you go about in life, beware of cheap offers, they can be terrible. Nothing is free.

a food or flavour you don‘t like: Indomie

a recommendation for something and why: book, TV show, film, place to visit in the world (or in Salzburg): I will love to visit Badagry in Nigeria. This town on the east side of Lagos was the “Point of No Return” in the Nigerian slave trade for 400 years. It is now home to three museums about the Badagry slave trade and Badagry history.

one German language word you have learned, or think is useful for others to know: Liebe, why: Love is the indescribable force that can turn our world upside down and ignite a fire within us like no other. It’s a complex emotion transcending boundaries, permeating every aspect of our lives. Love makes us human, connecting us deeply and reminding us of our shared humanity. Through love, we find compassion for others.
